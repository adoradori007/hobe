You'd expect them to be Aston Villa, especially if Jack Grealish is still missing.  But then they have the second leg against Real Madrid. 

Mallik Wilks struck Hull's second in the 57th minute to make it two wins in a row for Gavin McCann's men. 

Enock Mwepu and Jeremy Sarmiento are both out injured for the visitors but Alexis Mac Allister and Leandro Trossard are available after recovering from Covid-19.

Fati was then forced back into the treatment room after picking up a hamstring injury in early November, with 11 games missed on that occasion.

The Reds won the English title in 2019-20 after a 30-year wait, having previously gone close in 2013-14.

As he progressed through the youth ranks at the club, he was a player Arsene Wenger identified as a talent with the potential to go far.

In the second, there were over-hit passes and misdirected efforts on goal.  Sadio Mane missed a gilt-edged one-on-one chance. 

We've got an atmosphere where young players can develop really well.Ben Grounds Vieira gamble paying off Everyone at Crystal Palace needs a huge pat on the back. 

Robbie Crawford was unable to direct Scott Tiffoney's cross on target, Graham flashed a shot wide and Tiffoney was also off target.

Sometimes things go against you, but we had the feeling we wasn't playing badly.  We had some good moments but sometimes you have to force the luck. 

Phillips, who has been with the Whites since he was 14, was one of the heroes of their promotion campaign two years ago and is now considered one of the Premier League's finest midfielders. 

The Ghana midfielder's absence at the start of this calendar year, due to Africa Cup of Nations duty and suspension, was another bleak period for the Gunners. 

The word legend is thrown out without thinking, some of the players I was lucky to play with did it for six, seven, eight, 10 years - and that's why they are so revered at Liverpool. 

Burnley will hope the 29-year-old can add firepower to their frontline following the surprise departure of striker Chris Wood to Newcastle for £25m earlier in the window.

If he is out for eight weeks, he would miss two Champions League group games and up to 10 Premier League matches.

I've meant to take some time off after I finished playing and I promised the family that we would have some time together and it's never happened. 

This time, all being well, United will appoint a manager with a record of success at home and in Europe, a manager whose achievements are in the present and not the past, a manager who has both nothing and something to prove. You'd think that would be the baseline for anybody coming into the job, and yet the last time they did that it was 1986. This is not to compare Ten Hag and Alex Ferguson; that would obviously be unhelpful. But it's about time a United board took the managerial appointment seriously.

The 33-year-old, who sits second in the all-time Bundesliga top goalscorer list with 309 goals in 379 appearances, admitted he is pondering his future.

Alternative tables: Man Utd runners-upMartial transforms Manchester UnitedAll it is with Man Utd is a bit of consistency and confidence. 

United's European exploits have proved a welcome distraction from the toils of the Premier League, which forced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer out of his job at the weekend after the club fell to Watford 4-1.

The second round group stage of qualifying consists of ten four-team groups in which only the top side move into the final round of playoffs, resulting in five teams making it to Qatar. 

Kane had a sighter when he expertly swivelled inside Craig Cathcart to test Daniel Bachmann before Hojbjerg invited Sergio Reguilon to arrow his shot hard towards the far corner, bringing a fine two-handed save from the Watford goalkeeper. 

Since then Villa have won four out of their six Premier League games, with the two defeats coming against Manchester City and his former club Liverpool.

Inter coach Simone Inzaghi was booked for his furious reaction before the spot-kick was eventually awarded and scored, as was Koulibaly.
